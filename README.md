# setup-dotnet

Fast .NET SDK/Runtime installation for GitHub Actions.

Parallel downloads, automatic caching, and smart version resolution.

## Quickstart

```yaml
- uses: fast-actions/setup-dotnet@v1
  with:
    sdk-version: '10.x'
```

## Features

- **Flexible installation**: Install SDK, Runtime, and/or ASP.NET Core Runtime
- **Parallel downloads**: Multiple requested versions download concurrently
- **Smart version resolution**: Wildcards (`10.x`, `10.x.x`) and keywords (`latest`, `lts`, `sts`)
- **Full `global.json` support**: Supports `global.json` file for SDK version resolution
- **Intelligent deduplication**: Skip redundant installs when an SDK already includes the requested runtimes
- **Automatic caching**: Cache the .NET installation directory to speed up subsequent runs
- **Conditional installation**: Uses pre-installed system .NET when all versions are present
- **Non-root installation**: Installs to user-writable tool cache without requiring root permissions

## Common Use Cases

```yaml
# Use latest LTS SDK
- uses: fast-actions/setup-dotnet@v1
  with:
    sdk-version: 'lts'

# Multi-target testing (latest SDK + multiple runtimes)
- uses: fast-actions/setup-dotnet@v1
  with:
    sdk-version: 'latest'
    runtime-version: |
      9.0.0
      8.0.0
      7.0.0

# Runtime-only (no SDK)
- uses: fast-actions/setup-dotnet@v1
  with:
    runtime-version: '8.0.x'

# From global.json
- uses: fast-actions/setup-dotnet@v1
```

## Version resolution

- **Wildcards**: `10.x` is treated as `10.x.x` and resolves to the latest matching version
- **Keywords**: `latest`, `lts`, `sts` resolve via the .NET releases index
- **Preview selection for keywords**: set `allow-preview: true` to include preview channels in keyword resolution

## Caching

- Enabled by default (`cache: true`)
- **Unified cache**: One GitHub Actions cache entry per run, keyed by platform, architecture, and a hash of all _resolved_ versions
- Installation directory is checked first; if versions are missing, the unified cache is restored (if present), then each version is installed from cache or downloaded
- Cache key uses resolved versions (not input patterns): if `10.x` resolves to a newer patch later, the key changes and the action downloads the new set
- `cache-hit` is `true` when all requested versions came from cache, `false` otherwise

## Performance

**Benchmark Results** (`ubuntu-latest`):

| Scenario                                                 | Official Action | fast-actions (without cache) | fast-actions (with cache) |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Multiple SDKs (10.x, 9.x, 8.x)                           | ~24s            | ~15s                         | ~6s                       |
| Single SDK + Runtimes (SDK 10.x, ASP.NET Core 9.x + 8.x) | (Not possible)  | ~9s                          | ~4s                       |

**Note**: Actual performance depends on various factors including runner specifications and network conditions.

## Motivation behind `fast-actions/setup-dotnet`

I built this GitHub Action because I care a lot about workflow execution time. The official `actions/setup-dotnet` works great for most cases, but in my workflows it was consistently slower than I wanted (especially when the runner spends a bunch of time installing multiple SDKs/Runtimes).

I tried to improve the official action first: I opened a PR there, but it ended up being ignored/stalled. Rather than keep waiting, I rebuilt the idea with a different focus: faster installs, better parallelization, and caching.

This isn’t meant to replace the official action for everyone. If you don’t care about shaving minutes off CI, you can stick with `actions/setup-dotnet`. If you do care about execution time (or you install multiple versions regularly), `fast-actions/setup-dotnet` is for you.
