# TypeScript & Logging

## Code Style

- **Tabs** (not spaces), **single quotes**, LF line endings
- **Variable names must be written out in full** – no abbreviations: `versionNumber` not `versionNum`, `installationDirectory` not `instDir`, `platform` not `plat`
- **Never use `any` or `unknown`** – always provide explicit types
- **Avoid over-commenting** – code should be self-explanatory
- **No JSDoc comments** – remove `/** ... */` blocks that only describe what functions do
- **No @param/@returns tags** – parameter and return value descriptions are unnecessary
- **No comments that repeat function names** – if the comment just restates the function name, remove it
- **Keep concise comments for "why"** – short, crisp comments explaining non-obvious context or important decisions are OK
- **Format descriptions are OK** – brief format examples for parsing functions are acceptable
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose; prefer early returns over nested conditions
- Biome organizes imports on save

## Logging

- `core.info()` for user-visible messages
- `core.debug()` for troubleshooting – **short and actionable**
- Log at: function entry, before/after async, API calls, cache operations
- **Avoid excessive debug logging** – too many debug lines make logs hard to read
- Prefer concise messages: `Resolved x.x.x -> 10.0.100` instead of multiple separate logs
